# RenameNhentaiFolders
Renames directory names from 'number' to 'title [artists] {parodies} (number)' where number is the nhentai number of the work. Can either take individual directories as arguments or the path of the parent directory containing intended directories. Can only traverse the immediate subdirectories of the parent.
